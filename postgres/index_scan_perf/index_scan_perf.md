# Introduction
When it comes to query performance, indexes are commonly referred to as the magic remediation. In most cases, indexes speed up queries significantly. But why?
In this article, we will look at the Index Scan operation in Postgres.
- Explain why the index is fast in certain situations
- The scenario in which index doesn't perform as good as we imagine
- Additional operation to improve index scan

This article only examine BTREE indexes.

# Sequential Scan & Index Scan
To understand why index scan is fast, we use Sequential Scan operation as the baseline. Sequential Scan operation is the default option of Postgres if no indexes are available.

## First insight
First, we examine the procedure of Sequential Scan and Index Scan operation.

- In a sequential Scan operation, PG visits the heap space. It reads all the table data, page by page. Then it checks every tuple if it matches the filter condition and is visible for the query.
- In an Index Scan operation, PG does the following actions, in order:
  - PG visits the index space first and finds the relevant index tuples.
  - Index tuples are pointers to heap tuples. It contains information to locate the tuple in the heap space: the page and offset. PG uses this information to read the page and retrieve the relevant tuples.

By comparing these two procedures, we can gain the first insight into index scan performance. PG identifies the data it need using index. Then it only visits a few blocks instead of the whole table.

However, this is a qualitative statement. What if the number of blocks identified by index is important?

We need a quantitative analysis. PG has a sophisticated system to evaluate the cost of an execution plan. Higher costs lead to slower the operations. We will compare the cost of sequential scan and index scan.

## Quantitative analysis

### Postgres cost constants
In PG, the term of `cost` refers to a number in an arbitrary unit, that indicates how heavy the operation is. The following are the costs of basic operations in PG:

**seq_page_cost**: Cost to fetch a page from disk in a series. Default value is 1.0.

**random_page_cost**: Cost to fetch a page from disk randomly. Default value is 4.0.

**cpu_tuple_cost**: Cost to process a data entry. Default value is 0.01.

**cpu_index_tuple_cost**: Cost to process an index entry. Default value is 0.005.

**cpu_operator_cost**: Cost of execute an operator in a query. Default value is 0.0025.

In the following calculation, we use:
- T refers to the number of pages in the table
- N refers to the number of tuples in the table
- t refers to the number of pages in the index
- n refers to the number of tuples in the index

We assume there is 1 condition in the query.

### Sequential Scan cost

Based on the function `cost_seqscan` in `/postgres/src/backend/optimizer/path/costsize.c`, we can compute the cost of sequential scan like following: 

Sequential scan cost consists of CPU cost and IO cost:
$$sequential\\_scan\\_cost = seq\\_cpu\\_cost + seq\\_IO\\_cost$$

For CPU, PG check all the tuples against the conditions, plus the cost to process a data entry:
$$seq\\_cpu\\_cost = (cpu\\_tuple\\_cost + cpu\\_operator\\_cost) * n\\_tuples = 0.0125 * N$$

For IO, PG must visit all the pages. Heap pages read are sequential:
$$seq\\_IO\\_cost = seq\\_page\\_cost * n\\_pages = T$$

The total cost of a sequential scan operation is:
$$sequential\\_scan\\_cost = 0.0125 * N + T$$

### Index Scan cost

In an index scan, there are 2 steps: visit the index space and the heap space:
$$index\\_scan\\_cost = index\\_cost + heap\\_cost$$

Each stage has it own cpu cost and IO cost:
$$index\\_cost = index\\_cpu\\_cost + index\\_IO\\_cost$$
$$heap\\_cost = heap\\_cpu\\_cost + heap\\_IO\\_cost$$

#### Index cost
The index space visiting cost using BTREE  is computed by 2 functions `genericcostestimate` and `btcostestimate` located in `/src/backend/utils/adt/selfuncs.c` file.


> **Selectivity**
>
> In Index Scan, **selectivity** refers to the ratio of the number of index entries that satisfy the filter conditions on the total number of index entries.
>
> In the calculation, we use `s` to refer to `Selectivity`. We have:
> $$n\\_index\\_tuples\\_read =  s * n\\_index\\_tuples = s * n$$ 
> and:
> $$ n\\_index\\_pages\\_fetched = s * n\\_index\\_pages = s * t$$


Index CPU cost consists of the cost to traverse the tree to find relevant index tuples and the cost to process those tuples:
$$index\\_cpu\\_cost = tree\\_traversal\\_cost + (cpu\\_index\\_tuple\\_cost + cpu\\_operator\\_cost) * n\\_index\\_tuples\\_read$$ 

With:
$$tree\\_traversal\\_cost = ceil(log(n\\_index\\_tuples)/log(2)) * cpu\\_operator\\_cost + 50 * cpu\\_operator\\_cost * (tree\\_height + 1)$$ 

So:
$$index\\_cpu\\_cost = ceil(log(n)/log(2)) * 0.0025 + 0.125 * (tree\\_height + 1) + 0.0075 * s * n$$

As the goal is not to compare the exact value of index cost, but rather to see its evolution, we can remove `log(n)`, `tree_height` and constants from the formula. They tend to be minor compare to  `0.0075 * s * n` when `n` is large.

When it comes to IO, index pages are read randomly: 
$$index\\_IO\\_cost = random\\_page\\_cost * n\\_index\\_pages\\_fetched = 4 * s * t$$

We have the `index_cost` formula as following:
$$index\\_cost = 0.0075 * s * n + 4 *  s * t$$

#### Table cost

Table CPU cost related to the cost to process a data entry and the cost to check conditions

$$table\\_cpu\\_cost =  (cpu\\_tuple\\_cost + cpu\\_operator\\_cost) * n\\_tuples\\_fetched$$

With:
$$n\\_tuples\\_fetched = s * n\\_tuples = s * N$$

We have:
$$table\\_cpu\\_cost = 0.0125 * s * N$$


Table IO cost depends on the number of pages we need to retrieve from PG. This number is computed in `index_pages_fetched` function located in `postgres/private/postgres/src/backend/optimizer/path/costsize.c`. It depends on a new factor: `Index Correlation`

> **Index Correlation**
>
>It indicates the similarity between the logical order of index entries and the physical order of corresponds heap entries. The range of index correlation values is [-1, 1]. The value 1 means index entries and heap entries are in the same order. The value -1 means they are in inverted order. When this value is 0, there are no correlation at all between them. In the calculation, we use `C` to refer to Index Correlation.

There are 3 situations
- Best case (C = 1 or C = -1)
- Worst case (C = 0)
- Normal cases (C is between -1 and 1 but not equals to 0).

**Best case**

In case of high correlation, the order of index entries and heap entries totally match. The first heap visit is random, but all subsequent reads are sequential. In addition, the number of heap pages to read is the fraction of the table identified by Selectivity.

$$table\\_IO\\_cost\\_best\\_case = random\\_page\\_cost + seq\\_page\\_cost * (s * n\\_pages - 1)$$

Like above, we can remove constants from the formula, we have:
$$table\\_IO\\_cost\\_best\\_case = s * T$$

**Worst case**

In case of low correlation, PG use an approximation of number page to fetch

```C++
 * We use an approximation proposed by Mackert and Lohman, "Index Scans
 * Using a Finite LRU Buffer: A Validated I/O Model", ACM Transactions
 * on Database Systems, Vol. 14, No. 3, September 1989, Pages 401-424.
 * The Mackert and Lohman approximation is that the number of pages
 * fetched is
 *	PF =
    *		min(2TNs/(2T+Ns), T)			when T <= b
    *		2TNs/(2T+Ns)					when T > b and Ns <= 2Tb/(2T-b)
    *		b + (Ns - 2Tb/(2T-b))*(T-b)/T	when T > b and Ns > 2Tb/(2T-b)
```


- when T > b and Ns <= 2Tb/(2T-b)
$$table\\_IO\\_cost\\_worst\\_case = 4 * PF  = 8TNs/(2T+Ns)$$

- when T > b and Ns > 2Tb/(2T-b)
$$table\\_IO\\_cost\\_worst\\_case = 4(b + (Ns - 2Tb/(2T-b))*(T-b)/T)$$

For other cases, the cost is computed as prorated between the worst and the best case using C<sup>2</sup>.
All the element contribute to the index cost is depend  on `s`, we will draw a graph that illustrate this relation.
Consider a table with: 
```
T = 600000
N = 54000000
b = 524288
t = 344018
n = 54000000
```
